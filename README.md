# Psychic-Game

This is the creation of a game called Psychic Game. This app is useful because it shows how Javascript code can be used to dynamically update HTML and CSS.

The Psychic Game is a guessing game between the computer and the player. The page is split into 4 sections; wins, losses, guesses left, and guesses so far. The objective of the game is to guess the letter that the computer is holding in order to increase wins against losses. You are allowed to guess a maximum of 9 times before the number of losses goes up. If you guess the correct letter then the guesses left will automatically reset to 9 and your wins will go up. The guesses so far section will list all of the letters you guessed until it reaches 9 letters and then it will reset to a blank to start a new round.

This project is useful because it shows how a simple HTML can be changed by Javascript to make dynamic game.

The creation of this game starts out with pseudo-coding all of the steps in detail. Then comes the assigning of variables, creating objects which contains functions and if/else statements. After you've checked that the game is working through console.log you can go in and edit the HTML elements to make the webpage become a functioning dynamic game.  

There were many examples of similar projects found on Github, Stack Overflow, and W3 Schools which you could use as reference. However just googling certain parts that you are stuck on help as well. (*Google Fu!*) Also, turning to your classmates helps a great deal. I learned that just by talking it out with classmates, often times you are able to answer your questions yourself! 

Happy Coding!!
